Showcase for generating the c3s model with agx

    I have modified the design model in order to be generated with agx,
    mostly that involved application of stereotypes and removing spaces from
    identifiers.
    
to run it, simply run bootstrap.py and buildout and execute sample-sqlalchemy.py
and have a look at test.db
