Papyrus ist ein quelloffenes Werkzeug zur Erstellung von UML-Diagrammen.

The models were developed with Papyrus, an UML designer plugin for Eclipse.
The configuration is as follows:

Download the Eclipse Modeling Tools package from
`eclipse.org <http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/>`_.
If you already have an existing Eclipse installation,
make sure it is up to date (Eclipse Juno 4.2)

Next you need to install Papyrus.

Usually it should be possible to install plugins via the Component Installer
(Help | Install Modeling Components) but for some reason this did not work
with Papyrus as there were some unresolvable dependency issues.
Thus, Papyrus was installed manually.

Go to the `Papyrus downloads website <http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/papyrus/downloads/index.php>`_
and download the latest release (the model was set up with 0.9.1 2012/09/19).
You will receive the file "Papyrus-Update-incubation-0.9.1.zip".
Install it by going to Help | Install New Software.
Click the Add button and choose Archive.
This opens a file open dialog where you have to select the downloaded file
**Papyrus-Update-incubation-0.9.1.zip**.
Hit OK on the file open dialog and the Add Repository dialog.
The Install New Software dialog will then show the package available
in the ZIP archive, which is "Papyrus". Check the box and click Next.
This should add Papyrus to your Eclipse installation.
	
When working with Papyrus models, it is useful to use the Papyrus perspective.
If it is not opened automatically, you can find it at
**Window -> Open Perspective -> Other -> Papyrus**.
